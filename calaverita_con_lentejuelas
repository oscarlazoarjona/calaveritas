        Calaverita con Lentejuelas

        Juanga hung his sequin suit.
        With him dead no one's got
        pitch or answer so acute:
        - What one sees, one asks not! -

        Oh Death! You filled us with pain!
        Pale lady! When's to end this lack?
        She sings soft: - When will you come back
        to Mexico once again? -

        The dead are all so merry:
        - To celebrate! Now's the chance!
        All round the cemetery,
        Noa Noa, let's go dance! -
