				Calaveritas Parlamentarias

				Death went into parliament
				To Bercow at once she told:
				- Of your seat Iâ€™ll now make bold
				And I will sit in judgement -

				At once Corbyn rose to his feet
				And though Death he did not fear
				still no protest would she hear
				telling him the voters to meet.

				Theresa May from her clutches
				was spared. It is worse punishment
				than no Brexit or government
				that she sits on the back-benches.

				Also with Death Johnson had no sway:
				- Do or die, didn't you say? -
				- Well now is past the day,
				and so I'll take you, with no delay! -
